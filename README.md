# 🧠 Stroke Prediction Model  
  
Predicting strokes before they strike! This project leverages machine learning to analyze health and lifestyle factors, providing a data-driven assessment of stroke risk. It’s like your personal health advisor, minus the medical degree (and the judgment).  

---

## 🚀 Overview  

This project implements five machine learning models to predict the likelihood of a stroke based on features such as age, health conditions, and lifestyle choices. It’s designed to help researchers, healthcare professionals, and data enthusiasts make informed predictions using a range of techniques.

## 🛠️ Models Implemented  

To ensure we cover all our machine learning bases, we’ve implemented:  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Your friendly neighborhood classifier.  
- **Decision Tree:** Because sometimes, life is all about making the right split.  
- **Logistic Regression:** The smooth talker of probability prediction.  
- **Naive Bayes:** Surprisingly effective, even if it assumes the world is overly simplistic.  
- **Neural Network:** The brainy one that likes to overthink (but delivers).

## 🔑 Features Used  

Our models take a deep dive into the following factors:  
- **Gender:** Male, female, or other—strokes don’t discriminate.  
- **Age:** A critical risk factor, no surprises here.  
- **Hypertension:** High blood pressure, the silent troublemaker.  
- **Heart Disease:** Your heart’s performance review.  
- **Ever Married:** Because stress is real.  
- **Work Type:** Sedentary vs. active lifestyles.  
- **Residence Type:** Urban or rural vibes.  
- **Average Glucose Level:** Sweetness overload warning.  
- **BMI (Body Mass Index):** Because numbers on a scale matter (sometimes).  
- **Smoking Status:** Quitters do win here.

## 📊 Model Performance  

What’s a machine learning project without some bragging rights? Our models are evaluated using:  
- **Accuracy:** Who got it right the most.  
- **Precision:** Who was confident and correct.  
- **Recall:** Who didn’t miss a thing.  

And for your viewing pleasure, we’ve included:  
- Bar charts comparing accuracy scores  
- Precision and recall visualizations (spoiler: they look great!)

## 🧑‍💻 Usage  

Ready to dive in? Here's how:  

1. **Install the required Python libraries:**  
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import pandas as pd
   import seaborn as sns
   import sklearn
   import tensorflow as tf

2. **Load the dataset:**  
   ```python
   dataset = pd.read_csv("stroke.csv")
   ```  

3. **Preprocessed and ready to go:**  
   - Numerical features are scaled between 0 and 1.  
   - Categorical values are encoded as integers (don’t worry, the code comments have your back).  

4. **Make predictions:**  
   Provide the required features, and our models will take care of the rest. Pro tip: If you disagree with the predictions, blame the data, not the models.  

5. **Consensus Prediction:**  
   We use a majority voting system across all models for a robust final prediction. Democracy in action, folks!

## 🛠️ Data Preprocessing  

Before diving into the fun part (training models), we’ve handled the essentials:  
- **Missing values:** Because empty cells don’t predict strokes.  
- **Feature scaling:** Leveling the playing field for numerical values.  
- **Categorical encoding:** Teaching the models how to read text.  
- **Train-test splitting:** So we don’t cheat during evaluation.  

---

## 🌟 Results  

The models perform admirably, each bringing its unique strengths to the table. But the real MVP is the majority voting system, combining their wisdom to make more reliable predictions.  

---

## 🤔 Future Improvements  

Because no project is ever perfect (or done):  
- Advanced feature engineering (we’ll find more things to blame strokes on).  
- Hyperparameter tuning (letting the models unleash their full potential).  
- Ensemble methods (teamwork makes the dream work).  
- Additional validation techniques (trust, but verify).  
- Smarter voting mechanisms (AI democracy 2.0).
